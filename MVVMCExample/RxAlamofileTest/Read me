It is simple example How to use MVVMC in Swift3

use libs: RxSwift, RxCocoa, RxAlamofire, Alamofire

In this project I use Drive instance of Binding: 

Binding VS Driver in RxSwift

I will try to improve it with an example:

Imagine you have this code:

let intObservable = sequenceOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    .observeOn(MainScheduler.sharedInstance)
    .catchErrorJustReturn(1)
    .map { $0 + 1 }
    .filter { $0 < 5 }
    .shareReplay(1)
    
Driver You can read more in detail what the Driver is all about from the documentation. In summary, it simply allows you to rely on these properties: - Can't error out - Observe on main scheduler - Sharing side effects

if you use Driver, you won't have to specify observeOn, shareReplay nor catchErrorJustReturn.

In summary, the code above is similar to this one using Driver:

let intDriver = sequenceOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)
    .asDriver(onErrorJustReturn: 1)
    .map { $0 + 1 }
    .filter { $0 < 5 }
